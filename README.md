 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, and owner type. It uses real-world data from sources like Quikr or OLX.

 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning** – Remove duplicates, handle missing values, fix inconsistent naming
2. **Feature Engineering** – Extract company/model, encode categorical variables
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis** – Visualize trends, correlations, and outliers
4. **Model Training** – Train regression models to predict price
5. **Model Evaluation** – R² Score, MAE, RMSE
6. **Prediction Interface** – Simple function or GUI for price prediction
